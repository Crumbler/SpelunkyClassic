 INTRODUCTION
=========================

Hey, people!  I'm releasing the source code in the hopes that you can
learn from it and create some cool stuff of your own.  I apologize in
advance if anything is not as straightforward, efficient, or clean as it
could be.  I did my best to provide comments where necessary!


=========================
 OPENING THE SOURCE
=========================

To open the .gmk files, you will need some version of Mark Overmars's
Game Maker (I used both version 7.0 and 8.0).  It can be obtained for
$25 from <http://www.yoyogames.com/make>.

To obtain the data files required to play the game, download Spelunky from
<http://www.spelunkyworld.com>.

Unfortunately, I can't commit to answering every question about the source
code.  Your best bet is to post on the forums!  Your question may have
already been answered there.


=========================
 CREDITS
=========================

Some smart and generous people have made Game Maker a lot better by extending
its basic functionality with scripts.  I used the following in Spelunky:

The BASIC PLATFORM ENGINE was by Martin Piecyk
<http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~mfp27/platformengine/>.

The game uses tsg1zzn's SUPER SOUND SYSTEM library for Game Maker to play
OGG VORBIS music files and do CROSS-FADING and PANNING.

The game incorporates ChevyRay's VIEW-SCALING SCRIPTS.
